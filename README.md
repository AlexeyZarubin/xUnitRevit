## Introduction

This section should hold a quick intro on what this repo's about. For example: 

This repo holds Speckle's: 
- base COC, 
- Contribution Guidelines, 
- README template (this one!),
- Issue Template,
- OSS License (Apache 2.0) & notice.

Either copy paste the parts that are useful in existing repos, or use this as a base when creating a new repository. 

## This Readme Template

Is rather straightforward. It includes several default sections and one section that requires special attention. 

Default sections: 
- Badges: has several default social badges. Feel free to add more. 
- Developing & Debugging - needs filling in!
- Community - can be left as is. 

**License section**: If this is a pure OSS repo, like Core, remove everything after the first phrase. Otherwise, we need to plan ahead before releasing and make sure we're covered. 

## Developing & Debugging

This doesn't make sense here, but in general, we should try to provide a small "how to" guide on local development and debugging, as it lowers the barrier to contributions. 

## Community 

The Speckle Community hangs out in two main places, usually: 
- on [the forum](https://discourse.speckle.works)
- on [the chat](https://discordapp.com/channels/726756379083145269/726756380199092258/746023170519203990) 

Do join and introduce yourself!
