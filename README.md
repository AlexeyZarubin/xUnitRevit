## Introduction

This section should hold a quick intro on what this repo's about. For example: 

This repo holds Speckle's: 
- base COC, 
- Contribution Guidelines, 
- README template (this one!),
- and Issue Template. 

Either copy paste the parts that are useful in existing repos, or use this as a base when creating a new repository. 

## Developing & Debugging

This doesn't make sense here, but in general, we should try to provide a small "how to" guide on local development and debugging, as it lowers the barrier to contributions. 

## Community 

The Speckle Community hangs out in two main places, usually: 
- on [the forum](https://discourse.speckle.works)
- on [the chat](https://discordapp.com/channels/726756379083145269/726756380199092258/746023170519203990)
